OpenScrewCounter is a machine built to count various small screws. It was built to simplify the counting procedure of set of screws for [IndyMill CNC machine](http://indystry.cc/indymill/). Researching similar solutions resulted in rejecting a few early ideas for the design of this project and in the end a approach presented above was implemented. At this stage the machine is not perfect and some upgrades are required to make it production ready.
